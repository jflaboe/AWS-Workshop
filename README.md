# AWS-Workshop
A repository dedicated to teaching some AWS tools related to scalable/serverless systems. This workshop is being taught as a part of a DotDev event. As such, some of the setup will be streamlined as I have created a *dotdev* AWS user under my own account. These credentials will continue to be available for a few days after the workshop. If you would like to complete this tutorial without those credentials, see [here](./docs/env_setup.md) for how to set up the development environment.

The actual workshop will contain two portions:
1. A presentation giving a brief background about how applications are built in general, what AWS and cloud providers are, and how we can use AWS to build applications.
2. Time for workshop attendees to actually get their hands dirty and build a small web application using S3, API Gateway, Lambda, and RDS from AWS

This repository mostly focuses on the second portion of the workshop, but I have also provided the background information for the sake of completion, see [here](./docs/background.md).

## Logging in to AWS
If you had to go through the development environment setup, you've created an AWS account yourself, so you can ignore this section.

Otherwise, navigate to the [AWS Console Login](https://940085495355.signin.aws.amazon.com/console) and enter the following:
- Username: dotdev
- Password: dotdev2019
